# Changelog

Release sections are added by `pnpm release`. Each section lists commit subjects since the previous `vX.Y.Z` tag.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-11-08

### Features

- Larger glossaries — each stored list (global or per site) now keeps up to 5,000 terms, up from 1,000. A translate run can carry the merged lists up to 10,000. Only terms that appear in the current text go into the model prompt. A user asked for a much larger glossary, and that seemed reasonable. (#23)
- Longer typed-text translation — paste up to 100,000 characters at once, up from 20,000. Long text is still split for the model. Surrounding page context stays at 20,000 characters. (#23)
- Faster GPU page translation — two paragraphs decode at once, each with its own cache, so long pages no longer slow down after paired paragraphs. The translated text is unchanged. CPU translation is untouched. (#22)

### Improvements

- Keyboard hints show Mac keys next to the Windows ones — Option+A, Option+B, and Option+S beside Alt+A/B/S, and ⌘+Enter beside Ctrl+Enter.
- Chrome Web Store listing matches the packaged locales — the name is "Sakutto - Local AI translation" (Japanese: "Sakutto - ローカルAI翻訳"). The short summary no longer repeats "Built with PLaMo"; that credit stays in the detailed description. (#17, #18)
- Clearer privacy policy for readers, in English and Japanese — translation runs on your device, there is no account, advertising, or analytics, and the only file the extension downloads is the model. (#21)

### Bug Fixes

- Text typed into a search box, message box, or form is no longer treated as page copy, including inputs wrapped in custom elements. Closed shadow roots stay out of reach. (#19, #20)
- A run of dots or asterisks in ordinary page text is no longer treated as a hidden password — only a real password field is masked that way. (#20)
- The on-page translation overlay is isolated from the host page, so a site script cannot read it, rewrite it, or turn on "always translate this site" for you.
- Model download remains the only network use — no page text, no credentials — and extension pages do not load remote scripts, styles, or fonts. The model file is kept only when its hash matches the pin. These surfaces are checked in tests. (#20)
